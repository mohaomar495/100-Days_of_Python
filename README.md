				100 Days of Python Pledge
I am committed to completing the 100 days of Python challenge.
I hereby pledge to work for at least an hour on Python programming for 100 days.
I will keep myself on track, even though some days I might feel tired or frustrated.
I will keep myself accountable, even though I have lots of things to do, I will make this a priority in my life.
I will overcome difficulties and achieve my goal. I will become a Python developer.
I believe in myself.
